# Poptionals

Ready to work with smart pointers and optionals?

## Collaborating using GitHub
Work with one other person for this lab. You will want to agree on style choices before you start coding.
* Both partners should clone the repository.
* Have one partner create a branch that includes both sets of initials, e.g. AB-CD-Pointers. Push it to the repository.
* The other partner can now update their project (the blue arrow in CLion's upper right corner). This will make the branch visible. Checkout the branch.
* Both partners will have to create their own CMakeLists.txt file for this lab. Use a file from a previous lab or project as a template.
    * If your lab will not compile because `<experimental/optional>` cannot be found, change the `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` from 14 to 17 in CMakeLists.txt. 

Now both partners are on the same branch. Any changes you push can be pulled by your partner and vice versa. To demonstrate this:
* Have one partner complete the optionals in section number 0 of main.cpp. The other partner can look on and advise.
* Commit and push the changes.
* Now have the other partner pull. The optionals should now appear in main.cpp.

Throughout this lab (and in future collaboration), make sure you perform the git commands in this order:
1. Commit
1. Pull
1. Push

## Working through the Pointers

* **Make sure you and your partner are working in different sections of main.cpp at any given time**.
* With one of you working in section 1 and one of you working in section 2, follow the prompt with **smart pointers**.
* Once you have finished a section, commit, pull, and push changes. Make sure to include the section you completed in your commit message.
* Use unique pointers as much as you can and only default to shared pointers when necessary.
  
Repeat the above steps with sections 3 and 4, and so on. 
  
Feel free to talk with each other whenever you have questions or aren't sure what to do. If you both get stuck, ask for help.
